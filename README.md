# react-github-search

I like lean code and try not to rely on obscure NPM modules and JS libraries, which are not supported well or not written for the "future".
I try to use as much of vanilla JS and ReactJS as possible.
Though I do use a bit of babel presets and plugins, so I could use arrow functions rather than bindings in the constructor.
I believe bind statements are pretty ugly for readability.
There should be no dependencies besides the ones for the build (babel, webpack, React, react-dom).

I did not use create-react-app as ejecting can be messy and boilerplate forces you to code to their format.

Did vanilla CSS for quickness and readability. Could use SASS for more advance projects where the CSS gets cumbersome.
No need for Bulma or Bootstrap when using CSS's flexbox and grid displays  for simple layout.

A  media query is in place for phone device types. Since there is only a form, I chose not to do a collapsing navigation bar when in mobile view.
And to stack the form choices for the user to be able to sort and search quickly.

#  Install Build Dependencies
