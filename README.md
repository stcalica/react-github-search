I'm very large into lean code and try not to rely on obscure NPM modules and JS libraries, which are not supported well or not written for the "future".
I try to use as much of vanilla JS and ReactJS as possible.
Though I do use a bit of babel presets and plugins, so I could use arrow functions rather than bindings in the constructor.
I believe bind statements are pretty ugly for readability and goes against lean code.
There should be no dependencies besides the ones for the build (babel, webpack, React, react-dom).

Did vanilla CSS for quickness and readability. Could use SASS for more advance projects where the CSS gets cumbersome.
No need for Bulma or Bootstrap when using CSS's flexbox and grid displays  for simple layout.

Media queries are in place for phone device types.
