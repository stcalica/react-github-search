React Github Search App

I'm very large into lean code and relying on obscure NPM module libraries which end up low on support or not written for future
I tried to use as much of vanilla JS and ReactJS as possible.
Though I did add quite a bit of babel dependencies so I could use arrorw functions rather than bind in the constructor, I think bind statements are pretty ugly to look at and read - going against lean code.
There should be no dependencies besides the ones for the build (babel, webpack, React, react-dom).

Did vanilla CSS for quickness and readability. Could use SASS for more advance projects where the CSS gets cumbersome.
No need for bulma or bootstrap when with CSS's flexbox and grid displays. 

#  Install Build Dependencies
`npm install`

# Run Demo
`npm start`
